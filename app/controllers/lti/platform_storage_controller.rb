module Lti
  # Provides a page to be loaded in an invisible iframe alongside LTI launches
  # for tools to send postMessages to the OIDC Auth domain instead of the
  # current Canvas domain. This is part of the LTI Platform Storage spec,
  # which allows tools to securely launch in browsers like Safari, and store
  # key/value data in Canvas' localstorage.
  #
  # For ease of rendering this sibling iframe alongside the LTI launch iframe,
  # this iframe initially has a src of `current_domain\post_message_forwarding`
  # which this controller will HTTP redirect to the needed src of
  # `OIDC_domain\post_message_forwarding?token=<JWT>`. The JWT contains the
  # original current_domain so that postMessages can be proxied from
  # Canvas to tool.
