#
# API for manipulating provisional grades
#
# Provisional grades are created by using the Submissions API endpoint "Grade or comment on a submission" with `provisional=true`.
# They can be viewed by using "List assignment submissions" or "Get a single submission" with `include[]=provisional_grades`.
# This API performs other operations on provisional grades for use with the Moderated Grading feature.
