# LTI Launches

An LTI launch is the act of loading an LTI tool (See [LTI Overview](./01_lti_overview.md)). LTI launches serve as the primary form of user authentication for the LTI tool.

LTI launches for LTI 1.1 and LTI 2.0 are very similar. Launches for LTI 1.3, however, are more distinct. The following is a description of LTI launches for each LTI version (See "Intro to Spec Versions" in [the LTI overview](./01_lti_overview.md)).
