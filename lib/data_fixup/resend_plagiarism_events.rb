module DataFixup
  # This fixup is meant to be run after a shard split.
  #
  # Plagiarism platform live event subscriptions use
  # the shard ID of events to deliver the event to
  # the correct customer.

  # This data fixup triggers a plagiarism_resubmit
  # event for all submissions that do not have a
  # scored originality report
  #
  # A start and end time may also be supplied.
  # If specified, only submission that were
  # submitted in the time range will have events
  # retriggered.
